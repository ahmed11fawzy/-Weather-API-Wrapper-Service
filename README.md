### Project Overview

This project is a Node.js application using TypeScript for type-safe development. It includes an Express server as a sample application, with a fully automated workflow for development, testing, and deployment. Key tools include:

TypeScript: For type-safe coding.
tsx: For fast execution and automatic reloading during development.
ESLint: For linting and enforcing coding standards.
Prettier: For consistent code formatting.
Jest: For unit and integration testing.
Husky: For pre-commit hooks to enforce code quality.
GitHub Actions: For continuous integration and deployment.

### Features

Fast development with tsx watch for instant reloads.
Strict TypeScript configuration for robust type checking.
Automated linting and formatting with ESLint and Prettier.
Unit testing with Jest and Supertest for HTTP endpoints.
Pre-commit hooks to ensure code quality before commits.
CI/CD pipeline with GitHub Actions for automated checks.

### Prerequisites

Node.js: Version 18 or higher.
npm: Version 8 or higher.
A code editor like VS Code (recommended for TypeScript and ESLint/Prettier extensions).

### Installation

Clone the repository:git clone <repository-url>
cd my-typescript-app

Install dependencies:npm install

Initialize Husky (for pre-commit hooks):npx husky init

### Scripts

Run these commands using npm run <script>:

start: Runs the compiled JavaScript application (node dist/index.js).
dev: Starts the development server with tsx watch src/index.ts for auto-reloading.
build: Compiles TypeScript to JavaScript (tsc).
lint: Lints TypeScript files (eslint 'src/**/\*.{ts,tsx}').
format: Formats code with Prettier (prettier --write 'src/**/\*.{ts,tsx}').
test: Runs Jest tests (jest).

### Development Workflow

Start the development server:npm run dev

This uses tsx to run src/index.ts and automatically reloads on file changes.
Access the sample Express server at http://localhost:3000.
Make changes to src/index.ts or other files; tsx will restart the server instantly.
Run npm run lint and npm run format to ensure code quality and consistency.
Run npm test to execute tests.

### Testing

Tests are located in src/**tests**.
Run tests with:npm test

The sample test (index.test.ts) uses Jest and Supertest to test the Express server’s endpoints.
Add new tests in src/**tests** following the pattern in index.test.ts.

### Code Quality

Linting: ESLint enforces TypeScript best practices and catches errors. Run:npm run lint

Formatting: Prettier ensures consistent code style. Run:npm run format

Pre-commit Hooks: Husky runs npm run lint and npm run format before each commit to enforce quality.

### CI/CD

A GitHub Actions workflow (.github/workflows/ci.yml) runs on push/pull requests to the main branch.
It performs:
Dependency installation.
Linting (npm run lint).
Formatting checks (npm run format).
Building (npm run build).
Testing (npm test).

### Contributing

Fork the repository.
Create a feature branch (git checkout -b feature/my-feature).
Make changes and commit with clear messages.
Run npm run lint and npm run format before committing.
Push to your branch (git push origin feature/my-feature).
Open a pull request.
